## Description of this program is This program implements a basic data compression algorithm called Run-Length Encoding (RLE) in C programming. It provides two functionalities through a simple menu-driven tool: Compression of text files using RLE, Decompression of previously compressed files to restore the original content. It works as TCompression Logic: It replaces sequences of repeated characters with the character followed by the count of repetitions. Example: aaabbbcccc becomes a3b3c4, Decompression Logic: It reads the compressed file and reconstructs the original file by repeating characters as per their count. Example: a3b3c4 becomes aaabbbcccc. Tools used for this program C Language (C99)	Core programming language VS Code. In vs code it is written.this program is applicable for Educational Purpose: Teaching concepts of data compression algorithms.Demonstrating file handling and string manipulation in C, Simple example for understanding lossless compression techniques.Real-World Applications: Compressing files with repetitive characters (e.g., logs, simple datasets), Part of larger systems where text compression is needed for storage optimization, Useful in embedded systems with memory constraints, where simple compression helps reduce storage size.Projects / Assignments:College assignments on file handling or compression algorithms, Demonstrating menu-driven programs with file input/output in C.This is the description of the program of data compression tools.
